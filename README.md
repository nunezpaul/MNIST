# MNIST Project Models

This repo contains (a) quick implementation(s) of digit recognition from the MNIST dataset.
This is repo is a more accurate representation of my coding ability after my first internship at Pinterest :)

## Model Plans
1. ~~embedding based basic model~~ (try something different) <br/>
 a. ~~Set up tensorboard logging~~
 
2. Noise-regularization (make the model more robust to random noise)

3. Mixture of Softmaxes (This shouldn't help but just for fun I'll implement) <br/>
