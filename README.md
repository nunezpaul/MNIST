# MNIST Project Models

This repo contains (a) quick implementation(s) of digit recognition from the MNIST dataset.
This is repo is a more accurate representation of my coding ability after my first internship at Pinterest :)

## Model Plans
1. ~~embedding based basic model~~ (try something different)
2. Noise-regularization (make the model more robust to random noise)
3. Mixture-Model (This should not help but just for fun I'll implement)
