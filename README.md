# MNIST Project Models

This repo contains (a) quick implementation(s) of digit recognition from the MNIST dataset.
This is repo is a more accurate representation of my coding ability after my internship at Pinterest :)

## Model Plans
1. ~~embedding based basic model~~ (try something different) <br/>
 a. ~~Set up tensorboard logging~~
 
2. ~~Auto-encoder~~ (most guides of this don't show actual implementation. Will implement based on the basic model as
multi-task learning)

3. ~~Mixture of Softmaxes~~ (This shouldn't help but just for fun I'll implement) <br/>
    (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03953.pdf)
    
4. CNN (Very typical to be used for this problem)

5. CNN + Mixture of Softmaxes
